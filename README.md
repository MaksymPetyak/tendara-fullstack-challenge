# Tendara Full-stack AI challenge

Tendara simplifies the process of applying for public sector tenders. A key step in this process involves drafting a document that outlines essential company information and the services offered. These documents can be lengthy and tedious to create, which is why we're building an AI writing copilot to streamline the task.

For this technical challenge, you’ll work on a mini-editor integrated with a chat-based AI copilot. Your objective is to design a flow that allows users to generate suggestions and seamlessly insert them into the editor. If you’ve used tools like Cursor, you might already be familiar with a similar workflow.

The key goal is to enable a user to request AI-generated content (e.g., a paragraph) and insert it at the correct position within the editor.

This challenge is intentionally open-ended, offering multiple ways to approach the implementation. We’re interested in how you solve problems, structure your code, and design the user experience.

Feel free to use any libraries or tools you find helpful. You are also welcome to use AI for coding, as we want this to resemble our real coding environment.

Please spend no more than 3 hours on this task. If you run out of time, feel free to add comments outlining the directions you would explore further.

We will provide you with a temporary OpenAI API key to use during the challenge.

## Installation
Installing the project should be as simple as running `yarn install`.

You can run the project with `yarn dev`.
